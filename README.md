8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

* Do NOT run this on a single core machine, it WILL wedge your terminal.
* This has some chance of breaking device drivers, with a slim chance of that leading to hardware damage. Rebooting to get certain devices working again is a very real possibility.
* Running this on a CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT kernel is probably going to create problems.
* Don't pin this to a core that handles important interrupts, in my experience core 0 is _usually_ the only one with dedicated interrupts but it depends.
